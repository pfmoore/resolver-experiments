1. Extras are a problem. Look at identify and the stuff in passa,
   the extra is part of the identifier but needs a dependency on
   the "non-extra" name to make sure all candidates get the same
   version.
2. Work out what get_preference does.
3. Not sure if the trace points in reporter are that useful...

Resolving requests is currently looping on cryptography 2.8. Not sure why.
  - Not including sdists?
  - Extras?
Looks like it was extras. ipython fails (no versions available). I suspect
that's from only considering wheels.

Debugging resolver failures is hard, f you don't know what you are doing!
Maybe add a load of diagnostic tracing? Maybe it's already present?
